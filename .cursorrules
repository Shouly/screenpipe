Rules:
- do not remove @ts-ignore except if i explicitly ask you
- loading and error UX: avoid using toast error things - its ugly af bro, instead use empty states, spinner in buttons and correct disabled states, use skeletons when no data is available yet, use error messages in the UI, etc.
- Rust: always use anyhow error, tokio instead of std stuff, avoid mutex if you can, prefer channels, write code easy to read for humans, fast for machines
- when i ask to give me the full code it means FULL, no fucking // rest of the code comments GIVE ME THE FULL CODE
- if it seems like you lack some context about a niche lib just ask me to provide the source code and i will (instead of providing a bad answer)
- NextJS: make sure to use tailwind, typescript, shadcn, lucide, magicui, and framer-motion to make UIs amazing
- Make sure to escape html thing like quotes etc properly. Only when necessary
- When writing react or html code make sure to use thing like &apos; instead of ". Only when necessary (e.g inside quote themselves)
- When I ask SQLite database related stuff, keep in mind my db is in $HOME/.screenpipe/db.sqlite and mp4 files in $HOME/.screenpipe/*.mp4
